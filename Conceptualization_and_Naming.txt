# Conceptualization and Naming

## Product Conceptualization

Our quantum computing product is designed specifically for space applications. It has several unique selling points (USPs) that set it apart from other quantum computing products:

1. **Radiation Resistance:** The product is built with radiation-hardened materials and components. This ensures that it can withstand the harsh radiation environment in space, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of quantum states and the overall performance of the quantum computer.

2. **Energy Efficiency:** The product is designed to consume minimal power. This is particularly important in space applications where power resources are limited. The energy-efficient design also helps to reduce the heat generated by the product, which is beneficial as heat dissipation is a challenge in space.

3. **Compact Design:** The product is compact and lightweight, making it suitable for space missions where every gram counts. Despite its small size, it does not compromise on its computing power and capabilities.

## Naming the Product

After careful consideration, we have decided to name our product "QuantumOrbit Module". This name reflects the product's quantum computing capabilities and its application in space. "QuantumOrbit" signifies the fusion of quantum technology and orbital (space) applications, while "Module" suggests that the product can be integrated into larger systems or used as a standalone unit.
